# SceneEditor
 Tutorials that derive from PardCode and Sir Neils tutorials that lead up to a scene editor. Each major output is labelled and sequestered to it's own branch.

Project BaseRenderer run instructions: 
Set entry file to main.cpp, set project configuration to Debug - x64
Compile and run, expected output is three shapes, a rainbow rectangle, a green rectangle, and a rainbow triangle (From top to bottom)

Rednder Test cases can be found on the branch "RenderTestCase" This branch reflects all the changes made across the test, 
but only runs to the last question as I was being time efficient.

Run instructions:
1. Download project
2. Add all c++ and h files to project (if not already there)
3. Set to debug with config x64 
4. Ensure the project has all directX dependencies included and that the hlsl files are excluded from the build
5. Lastly, build internally from visual studio
